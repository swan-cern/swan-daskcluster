class DaskSchedulerConfig:
    '''
    Helper class that provides information that is relevant for a Dask
    scheduler running in a SWAN user session, namely:
    - Private hostname: hostname that resolves to a private address that
    belongs to Docker's bridge network. The scheduler binds to such address.
    - Contact hostname: the hostname of the server that hosts the container.
    Used by the workers to contact the scheduler.
    - Port: a `PortAllocatorClient` is created to reserve a port for the
    scheduler to listen on, since it needs to receive connections from the
    workers.
